/**
 * PCalledPartyIDHeaderHandler is used to add and remove the P-CalledParty-ID
 * header
 * 
 * RFC 3455 says,
 * 
 * 4.2 The P-Called-Party-ID header
 * 
 * A proxy server inserts a P-Called-Party-ID header, typically in an INVITE
 * request, en-route to its destination. The header is populated with the
 * Request-URI received by the proxy in the request. The UAS identifies which
 * address-of-record, out of several registered address-of-records, the
 * invitation was sent to (for example, the user may be simultaneously using a
 * personal and a business SIP URIs to receive invitation to sessions). The UAS
 * may use the information to render different distinctive audiovisual alerting
 * tones, depending on the URI used to receive the invitation to the session.
 * Users in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) may get one or several SIP
 * URIs (address-of-record) to identify the user. For instance, a user may get a
 * business SIP URI and a personal one. As an example of utilization, the user
 * may make available the business SIP URI to co-workers and may make available
 * the personal SIP URI to members of the family. At a certain point in time,
 * both the business SIP URI and the personal SIP URI are registered in the SIP
 * registrar, so both URIs can receive invitations to new sessions. When the
 * user receives an invitation to join a session, he/she should be aware of
 * which of the several registered SIP URIs this session was sent to. This
 * requirement is stated in the 3GPP Release 5 requirements on SIP [4]. The
 * problem arises during the terminating side of a session establishment, when
 * the SIP proxy that is serving a UA gets an INVITE, and the SIP server
 * retargets the SIP URI which is present in the Request-URI field, and replaces
 * it by the SIP URI published by the user in the Contact header field of the
 * REGISTER request at registration time. When the UAS receives the SIP INVITE,
 * it cannot determine which address-of-record the request was sent to. One can
 * argue that the To header field conveys the semantics of the called user, and
 * therefore, this extension to SIP is not needed. Although the To header field
 * in SIP may convey the called party ID in most situations, there are two
 * particular cases when the above assumption is not correct: 1. The session has
 * been forwarded, redirected, etc., by previous SIP proxies, before arriving to
 * the proxy which is serving the called user. 2. The UAC builds an INVITE
 * request and the To header field is not the same as the Request-URI. The
 * problem of using the To header field is that this field is populated by the
 * UAC and not modified by proxies in the path. If the UAC, for any reason, did
 * not populate the To header field with the address-of-record of the
 * destination user, then the destination user is not able to distinguish which
 * address-of-record the session was destined. Another possible solution to the
 * problem is built upon the differentiation of the Contact header value between
 * different address-of-record at registration time. The UA can differentiate
 * each address-of-record it registers by assigning a different Contact header
 * value. For instance, when the UA registers the address-of- record sip:id1,
 * the Contact header value can be sip:id1@ua; the registration of sip:id2 can
 * be bound to the Contact value sip:id2@ua.
