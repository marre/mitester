Description
--------------

miTester for SIP is an open source test automation framework to automate all SIP call flows.
miTester for SIP is to make testing easy and quick. As the miTester for SIP automation framework executes entirely on XML scripts, both USER and  ADVANCED  modes of testing can be performed on SIP applications. No additional scripting needed for repetitive testing.
